# Task 8.1

---

- In this task, we will use what we learnt from Image Processing session. We are going to apply image processing using Open CV classical algorithm. Our goal is to detect red/blue balls from pictures.
- Our approach was to first, filter out all the image except the blue and red colors, then we can use open-CV’s Hough Circle Transform to detect circles. The sent parameters should be tuned further to improve the accuracy of the results. We then drew the circles around the balls. In two ways, in one image, we showed the blue balls colored in blue and the red balls colored in red. The other image colored all the balls in greed.
