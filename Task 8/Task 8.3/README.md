#  Egyptian Coin Detector YOLO Model

**Description:**

This project is a YOLO model that can detect Egyptian coins. It was trained on a dataset of over 50 images of Egyptian coins. The model can detect the following coins:

* One pound
* Half pound
* Quarter pound


**Contributions:**

The dataset was collected by all team members:

* Ahmed Youssef Sobhy Elgoerany
* Marawan El-Gharbawy
* Yousif Mohamed Mostafa Salama Elraey

Then Marwan proceeded to label the images, but Yousif found a much faster way to do so and found a platform called Datature, which could efficiently train the model with a much faster computation power, so we decided to keep going on this path since we were low on time.

After training the model, we included the model and the deployment file, alongside the dataset and the test cases.

There is another README.md file included which explains how to run the model and all details. (it also includes the website)

**Notes:**

* We didn't use a jupyter notebook using that method.
* Dataset is included and here's a drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18z9I2-IVjjMtUO_r4gi9qOhtunhgaKmb?usp=sharing
