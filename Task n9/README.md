# Task 9

---

In this task, we have designed a PCB that includes Arduino UNO as a microcontroller. It has a motor driver L298N, four ultrasonic sensors for each direction, and an MPU6050 IMU sensor.

To start, we downloaded the MIA library and had to look for an online library to include an Arduino.

**Board files included:**

- Schematic diagram.

We encountered a program when creating the PCB file: the Arduino board didn't appear in the PCB file, and too many errors occurred, so we uploaded the project as it is. 

We are still looking for an alternate library and will reupload the task if it works.
